# Reading time blocks

Gutenberg blocks to display the remaining reading time in a post.

## For education purposes
This WordPress plugin has been developed for educational purposes to try my hand at developing a Gutenberg blocks with a BDD approach: its value is in the code, not its functionalities.

## Installation
* clone this plugin in the WordPress plugin folder
* install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependencies running `composer install`

## Usage
Still a work-in-progress.
